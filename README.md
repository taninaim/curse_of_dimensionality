# The Curse of Dimensionality

This repo is a quick demonstration of the "Curse of Dimensionality". The concept illustrates the vastness of a high dimensional space. To illustrate this, one may compare a unit hypercube with width w = 2r with a hypersphere with radius r, centered at the middle of the hypercube. The volume(hypersphere):volume(hypercube) ratio converges to zero as the number of dimension K increases to infinity. This can be understood analytically as explained in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality#Distance_functions. Here we will show it via a simulation.
